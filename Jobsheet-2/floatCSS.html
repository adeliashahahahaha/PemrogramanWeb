        <h2>Float Kiri</h2>
        <div class="float1"></div>
        <p>
            I know that you're wrong for me <br>
            Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave<br>
            I brought you down to your knees<br>
            'Cause they say that misery loves company<br>
            It's not your fault I ruin everything<br>
            And it's not your fault I can't be what you need<br>
            Baby, angels like you can't fly down hell with me<br>
            I'm everything they said I would be<br>
            <img class="gambar" src="img/tulip.jpg">
            I'll put you down slow, love you, goodbye<br>
            Before you let go, just one more time<br>
            Take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine<br>
            A little more hurt won't kill you<br>
            Tonight my mom says, "You don't look happy"<br>
            Close your eyes<br>
        </p>
